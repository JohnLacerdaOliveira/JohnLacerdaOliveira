First things first, Hello my name is João Bernardo Oliveira but those who know me best call me Bernardo so perhaps we can start there.

If it’s true that the only constant in life is change I feel like I’ve fully embraced that fact and have thrived in it.

From a background in Mechanical Engineering, through some of the best kitchens in London and later in real estate as a property manager I’ve always embraced new challenges and the learning opportunities that come along with them.

Though seemingly unrelated, all of these experiences taught me skills and abilities that allow me to adapt quickly and effectively to all kinds of demands that any professional environment can pose.

With a lifelong fascination with technology I’ve come to appreciate the power of code as a force for good in the world and, through it, I aspire to be a part of that change. 

I’ll have succeeded in my efforts when one day my code has served to improve someone's life as much as mine has been bettered thanks to the code of others.
